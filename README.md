                                               IOT-Warning-system
   An IOT warning system ,which can be used in a variety of ways in healthcare as well as inventory sensitive to humidity and temperature changes. In our model we simulated our design using a heat gun and proposed our application for UPS monitoring system. Please refer the pdf slides for more details about the project.
